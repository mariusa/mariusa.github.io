                                        <p>We'll go through these phases:</p>

                                        <h2 class="section-title strong">1. Tell me about your business problems (at no charge)</h2>

                                        <p>In several discussions, I'll learn about your business and what pains you and your staff are
                                        confronting. Usually, problems are about</p>

                                        <ul>
                                                <li>spending too much <strong>time</strong> on a partially repetitive activity</li>

                                                <li>high recurring <strong>costs</strong></li>

                                                <li>low <strong>quality</strong> outcomes</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This phase is only about learning, identifying root causes, discussing workarounds you have
                                        tried etc.</p>

                                        <p>Ideas about potential solutions are welcome, but we'll just collect and set them aside for
                                        later. As Sherlock Holmes put it best, <i>"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
                                        Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."</i></p>

                                                        solves your biggest problem, collaborating with a professional interaction

                                        functional solution, as discussed in the previous phase. We will integrate existing components and services wherever it makes sense, instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>
