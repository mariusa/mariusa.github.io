    <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Let's improve your Business!</h2>

        <p>Here's how:</p>
        <div class="resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5">
            <div class="resume-content">
                <h3 class="">1. Tell me about your business problems (at no charge)</h3>

                <p>
                    In several video calls, I'll learn about your business and what pains you and your staff are confronting. Usually,
                    problems are about
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>spending too much <strong>time</strong> on a partially repetitive activity</li>

                    <li>
                        high recurring
                        <strong>costs</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li>low <strong>quality</strong> outcomes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This phase is only about learning, identifying root causes, discussing workarounds you have tried, etc.</p>

                <p>
                    Ideas about potential solutions are welcome, but we'll just collect and set them aside for later. As Sherlock Holmes put
                    it best,
                    <i
                        >"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,
                        instead of theories to suit facts."</i
                    >
                </p>

                <h3 class="">2. Design a solution</h3>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-8">
                        <p>
                            If things can be improved by using technology, I'll prototype a solution which solves your biggest problem,
                            collaborating with a professional interactive designer.
                            <br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We'll iterate over it until the proposed solution is clear, and you're happy with both the outcome and what it
                            takes to start using it.
                        </p>

                        <p>We'll also discuss costs of building and adopting this solution, compared with the problem's costs.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-4">
                        <img
                            class="img-fluid img-profile rounded-circle2 mx-auto"

                            title="Marius going over details with Brent"
                        />
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="">3. Build and deliver the agreed solution</h3>

                <p>
                    Together with a team of talented software engineers, we'll build and deliver the fully functional solution. We will
                    integrate existing components and third-party services wherever it makes sense, instead of reinventing the wheel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll also help with training, legacy data imports or anything else required for a successful, gradual rollout to all
                    staff which needs to start using it.
                </p>

                <h3 class="">4. Monitor outcomes and make adjustments</h3>

                <p>
                    After adopting the solution, we'll maintain it, fix remaining bugs, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) we agreed
                    to, and make adjustments to further improve them.

                            I'm passionate about nature, science, health, education, artificial intelligence, robotics, sci-fi and how to
                            make it real.

                        <p>
                            I believe "work" should be only smart and creative, and done not because one needs the money, but because one is
                            proud of the result.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We're definitely far from Star Trek's world, where
                            <i
                                >"economics of the future are somewhat different. You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th Century. The
                                acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest
                                of humanity."</i
